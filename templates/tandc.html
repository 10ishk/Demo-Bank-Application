            6. METHODOLOGY OF INTEREST CALCULATION:
            6.1 Interest rates are money market (i.e. simple interest) rates for tenors unto 6 months and quarterly compounded rates for tenors of 6 months and above. In case of cumulative FCNR (B) Fixed Deposits, interest rates are calculated at the applicable rate without any compounding effect for Fixed Deposits of up to one year and in respect of Fixed Deposits for more than 1 year, at intervals of 180 days each and thereafter for the remaining actual number of days with compounding effect. However, in case of traditional Fixed Deposits, interest rates are money market (i.e. simple interest) rates irrespective of the tenor of such Fixed Deposit.
            
            
            
            6.2 The method of calculation on interest on a Fixed Deposit, both traditional and cumulative Fixed Deposits is as under:
            For Traditional Fixed Deposits with quarterly payouts, interest is calculated based on annual rates (Simple Interest). However, in case of monthly payouts, interest is paid at a discounted value. For Traditional fixed deposits with quarterly payout, interest is calculated on the principal amount for completed quarters and then for the balance period, interest is calculated for completed months and further for incomplete month on actual number of days. In case of traditional FCNR (B) deposits, interest rates are calculated at the applicable rate without any compounding effect for Fixed Deposits up to one year and in respect of deposits for more than 1 year, at intervals of 180 days each and thereafter for the remaining actual number of days without compounding effect. For Cumulative Fixed Deposits, interest is compounded quarterly on completion of exact quarters. For the remaining period beyond completed quarters, simple interest is calculated on the cumulated deposit amount for remaining number of days. In case of cumulative FCNR (B) deposits, interest is calculated as per Clause 5.2 above.
            6.3 In case of premature withdrawal, the interest is calculated on the principal amount for completed quarters (completed half years in the case of FCNR (B) deposits) and then for the balance period, interest is calculated for completed months and further for any incomplete month, on the actual number of days elapsed.
            6.4 For the purpose of interest calculation calendar year is taken to consist of 365 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year. In case of FCNR (B) deposits, calendar year is taken to consist of 360 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.
            6.5 In respect of term deposit (cumulative, recurring and traditional) placed in automatic closure mode and are maturing on a holiday (including Sundays and 2nd and 4th Saturday), the deposit shall be closed on the next working day. Bank shall pay interest at the original contracted rate for holiday period on the succeeding working day.
            In case of cumulative deposits and recurring deposits, bank shall pay interest on the maturity value and in case of traditional deposits with interest payout option, interest shall be paid on the principal amount
